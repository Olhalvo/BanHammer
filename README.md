# BanHammer
A plugin by Well_thatssad that adds a literal Ban Hammer and Kick Hammer to your minecraft server

## Why did you commit the horrendous mistake to create this
Back in the middle of 2021 I was "working" as a plugin developer for a minecraft server and 
they had requested the creation of a banhammer plugin

## Who did you skid this code
Surprisingly enough this plugin's code was mostly mine, probrably with one or other thing from some
random kid from the spigot forum

## How do I use this
/banhammer or /banham to get the ban hammer
/kickhammer or /kickham to get the kick hammer
upon hitting a non opped player with it the player gets banned or kicked out from the server with a custom message in chat and in their client
if you don't posses the permition to use it, you will be killed and struck by ligthing, as you are not worthy

## How do I download 
Like most stuff from github you can compile this yourself or just nab the newest release
the plugin is also available on my spigot profile https://www.spigotmc.org/members/slaman123.952487/

## I have found an error, or your code just sucks
In case any of these two or any variation of it applies, just open an issue or PR on a branch with your name

## I loved this plugin is there any way I can contact you
There sure is
